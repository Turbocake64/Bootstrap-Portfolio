# Bootstrap-Portfolio

I failed to write a read me for the last homework so this is my first forray into document notation.
I hope it's formatted ok.

The Navbar works but is ugly. I can't get my name to sit atop the ul section and the ul items stack on top of each other once the screen gets too small.

I was finally able to get things to respond to the size of the screen and while some things are wonky like the text and photo of the index.html page not wrapping, for the most part I got it to do what I want. By no means do I think that this is a pretty assignment. 

I am thinking of it as more of a proof of concept: I have proved that I understand how to use bootstrap to maniupulate elements on a page. Am I great at it? No! But I look forward to getting better as I continue to use it, the grid system, and bootstrap's built in media queries. 

That being said, I welcome critiques on how I went about getting my responsiveness. I tried to avoid using the "@media" classes because the instructions said to avoid media queries, but frankly, I couldn't figure out how to get responsiveness without putting them in.

Thanks for reading!
