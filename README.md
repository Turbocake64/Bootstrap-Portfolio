# Bootstrap-Portfolio

(UPDATE!)

This is my updated Bootstrap Portfolio. I have included three assignments with links to gitHub in my portfolio and reorganized my three pages into one single page that toggles between the portfolio and about me section with a modal to substitute the contact me page. I took some liberty with the color scheme and, while the style isn't where I would like it, I have been inspired by some of my class mates' portfolio's and look forward to playing with some more css and js libraries to flesh mine out going forward.

Reflection:

It is interesting to see how much work I have done and how much easier it is to set up a webpage compared to when I first did this assignment. That being said I didn't have the time to get this assignment where I wanted it. I would have liked to hook the contact form to a firebase database so I could actually go through and see what kind of contact I was getting. Additionally, the modal does not show up if the About Me div is shown.
